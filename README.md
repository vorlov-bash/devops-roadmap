### ⚠️Disclaimer ⚠️

I'm not pretending to be a professional programmer and moreover DevOps specialist.

### Idea 💡:

The idea becomes to me when I've realized that DevOps skills are a big part of programming. For my projects, I had to
configure a server infrastructure, deploy, manage, and monitor my real projects such as bot for an insurance company.
For my amateur projects, I had to set up CI/CD in Github/GitLab repos, so I decided to create this repository, and
demonstrate my road to good DevOps and a good programmer.
